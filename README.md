# Bekah’s Bread Collection

A simple, single-page landing site built with **HTML + CSS** for Week 1 homework.

## What’s inside
- `index.html` – landing page with a hero, intro text, and a gallery
- `styles.css` – styles, including a tiny **CSS animation** (rising steam) and hover effects
- `assets/img/` – images used on the page

## How to run
Just open `index.html` in your browser.

## How to upload to GitHub
1. Create a new repository on GitHub (e.g., `beikas-bread-collection`).
2. Upload all files and folders in this project (keep the folder structure).
3. Enable GitHub Pages (Settings → Pages → Deploy from a branch → select `main` → `root`).
4. Wait a minute and visit the GitHub Pages URL shown in the Pages settings.
